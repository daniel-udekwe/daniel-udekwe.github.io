## VR-Based Intelligent Transportation System

This project presents a virtual reality platform designed to model, visualize, and analyze intelligent transportation systems within an immersive 3D environment. The simulation incorporates realistic traffic flow, roadway geometry, and vehicle dynamics to support research in driver behavior modeling, human–machine interaction, and transportation system safety.

The VR environment enables users to interact with complex roadway scenarios, explore intersections and corridors from multiple perspectives, and evaluate the influence of traffic control devices, ADAS features, and infrastructural changes on roadway performance. This makes it a powerful tool for transportation engineering education, experiment design, and decision support.
