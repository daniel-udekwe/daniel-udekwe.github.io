## Driving Simulator

This project features an advanced driving simulation environment designed to support research in driver behavior analysis, roadway safety evaluation, and intelligent transportation systems. The simulator integrates realistic roadway geometry, traffic conditions, and vehicle dynamics to create immersive scenarios that mirror real-world driving environments.

Researchers can use the system to examine factors such as speed choice, lane keeping, reaction to hazards, sun glare effects, and interactions with ADAS technologies. The setup is highly flexible, enabling custom scenario design, data collection, and controlled experimentation with both novice and experienced drivers.
