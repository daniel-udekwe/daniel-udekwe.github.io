## Virtual Reality–Based Engineering Lab for Surveying Education

This project presents an immersive virtual reality environment developed to enhance surveying education and improve learning outcomes for engineering students. The system simulates real-world surveying tools—such as total stations, leveling instruments, and prism rods—allowing users to practice measurement, alignment, and positioning tasks within a safe, controlled digital environment.

The VR lab is designed to support students with varying skill levels and learning styles while reducing equipment barriers, minimizing setup time, and enabling repeatable practice sessions. Through realistic physics, interactive tools, and guided tasks, the platform provides an intuitive and highly engaging method for experiential learning in civil engineering and geomatics.
