        "Regression is a statistical technique in machine learning and statistics that aims to establish a relationship between a **dependent variable (target)** and one or more **independent variables (features or predictors)**. The primary goal of regression analysis is to model the relationship between these variables, enabling the prediction or estimation of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simpler terms, regression helps us understand how the changes in one or more variables are associated with changes in another variable. It is widely used for prediction and forecasting, making it a fundamental tool in various fields, including finance, economics, biology, and social sciences.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several types of regression models, with linear regression being one of the most common. In linear regression, the relationship between the variables is modeled as a linear equation, representing a straight line on a graph. However, regression is not limited to linear relationships; non-linear regression models can capture more complex patterns, accommodating scenarios where the relationship between variables is curved or follows a different pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "The training process in regression involves fitting the model to historical data, allowing the algorithm to learn the underlying patterns. Once trained, the regression model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data, providing valuable insights and aiding decision-making processes.\n",

        "Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental and straightforward form of regression analysis where the relationship between two variables is modeled using a linear equation. In this case, there are two variables: one is considered the independent variable (often denoted as $X$), and the other is the dependent variable (often denoted as $Y$).\n",

        "\n",
        "This equation is similar to the line equation $y = mx +b$ with $m = \\beta_1$(Slope) and $b = \\beta_0$(Intercept). So in this Simple Linear Regression model we want to draw a line between X and Y which estimates the relationship between X and Y.\n",
        "\n",
