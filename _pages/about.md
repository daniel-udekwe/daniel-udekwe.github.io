I am a doctoral researcher in Civil Engineering at the [FAMU-FSU College of Engineering](https://eng.famu.fsu.edu), working under the supervision of [Qianwen (Vivian) Guo](https://eng.famu.fsu.edu/cee/people/guo). My research spans **transportation engineering**, with a focus on human–machine interaction and emerging computational methods that advance how transportation systems are designed and evaluated.

I hold a B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering, and my academic background reflects a strongly interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving. I am currently exploring the potential of quantum computing and virtual reality to support next-generation tools and methodologies in transportation network design.

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">I am on the job market in the academic year 2026-27, see my [CV](https://daniel-udekwe.github.io/assets/pdf/danielUdekweCV_A.pdf) here.</span>
