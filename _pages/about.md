I am a doctoral researcher in Civil Engineering at the [FAMU-FSU College of Engineering](https://eng.famu.fsu.edu), working under the supervision of [Qianwen (Vivian) Guo](https://eng.famu.fsu.edu/cee/people/guo). My research spans **transportation engineering**, intelligent systems, and emerging computational methods. I previously earned my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering, and my broader academic path reflects an interdisciplinary focus on both mobility systems and advanced computational tools

My work centers on the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and intelligent transportation systems. I develop data-driven and algorithmic frameworks for improving roadway safety, accessibility, and mobility, drawing on modern methods such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and quantum-inspired optimization. To support practical deployment, I build scalable simulation environments and toolchains—ranging from VR-based traffic and robotics simulations to hybrid classical–quantum optimization workflows.

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">I am on the job market in the academic year 2026-27, see my [CV](https://daniel-udekwe.github.io/assets/pdf/danielUdekweCV_A.pdf) here.</span>
