## Bio

I am currently a doctoral candidate at Florida State University, where I develop quantum-inspired optimization models, immersive VR simulation environments, and machine learning pipelines to address complex transportation challenges. Prior to this, I held similar research roles at Virginia Tech’s Intelligent Automation and Connected Technologies Lab.

I am the author of several peer-reviewed articles, and my work has been featured in both academic and applied engineering contexts.

I actively contribute to interdisciplinary research communities and am committed to translating advanced computational models into practical tools that enhance safety, mobility, and equity in transportation systems.

In addition to my academic research, I am an advocate for remote immersive learning technologies and the integration of virtual reality into collaborative professional environments.

## Key research interests

-   **Quantum Computing:** Developing quantum-inspired optimization frameworks and algorithms to address complex engineering problems.

-   **Virtual/Augmented/Mixed/Extended Reality:** Leveraging immersive virtual environments and XR technologies to facilitate interactive simulation, particularly to improve spatial reasoning.

-   **Human-Machine/Human-Robot Interaction:** Exploring advanced collaborative frameworks between humans and robotic systems for improving safety, efficiency, and effectiveness in complex operational tasks.

-   **Computational Intelligence:** Employing machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, and explainable AI techniques to analyze datasets and reveal hidden patterns.

-   **Control/Autonomous Systems:** Developing robust control frameworks for autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotic platforms for autonomous decision-making capabilities.

## Personal life

I was born in Northern Nigeria and have always had a deep appreciation for learning and discovery both within and beyond the boundaries of my academic work. I currently reside in Tallahassee, FL, where I balance my research interests with a wide range of personal passions.

Outside of academia, I have a longstanding fascination with history, particularly ancient civilizations and forgotten empires. I’m also deeply interested in prehistoric life and continue to explore the world of extinct species with the same curiosity I had as a child. Chess is another area of personal interest; I spend time studying various openings, often more for the intellectual challenge than competitive success.
