## Bio

I am currently a doctoral candidate at Florida State University, where I develop quantum-inspired optimization models, immersive VR simulation environments, and machine learning pipelines to address complex transportation challenges. Prior to this, I held similar research roles at Virginia Tech’s Intelligent Automation and Connected Technologies Lab.

I am the author of several peer-reviewed articles, and my work has been featured in both academic and applied engineering contexts.

In addition to my academic research, I am an advocate for immersive learning technologies and AI-enabled infrastructure.

My technical toolkit includes Python, MATLAB, ROS, Unity3D, and Qiskit, among others. I actively contribute to interdisciplinary research communities and am committed to translating advanced computational models into practical tools that enhance safety, mobility, and equity in transportation systems.

## Key research interests

-   **Virtual/Augmented/Mixed/Extended Reality:** Development and application of immersive technologies for simulation, training, and remote collaboration in civil and transportation engineering.

-   **Quantum Computing:** Leveraging quantum algorithms for solving complex optimization problems in transportation networks and intelligent systems.

-   **Computational Intelligence:** Application of neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and fuzzy systems for modeling, prediction, and decision support in engineering systems.

-   **Control/Autonomous Systems:** Design and analysis of autonomous agents and control strategies for unmanned vehicles and intelligent infrastructure.

-   **Human-Machine/Human-Robot Interaction:** Enhancing interactive systems for teleoperation, assistive robotics, and collaborative decision-making through intuitive and accessible interfaces.

## Personal life

I was born in Northern Nigeria and have always had a deep appreciation for learning and discovery both within and beyond the boundaries of my academic work. I currently reside in Tallahassee, FL, where I balance my research interests with a wide range of personal passions.

Outside of academia, I have a longstanding fascination with history, particularly ancient civilizations and forgotten empires. I’m also deeply interested in prehistoric life and continue to explore the world of extinct species with the same curiosity I had as a child. Chess is another area of personal interest; I spend time studying various openings, often more for the intellectual challenge than competitive success.
